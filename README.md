## About me 

I am R\&D engineer in computational fluid dynamics and energy systems with 6+ years of experience in research. 
I earned my PhD in early 2020 (just before the pandemic!) from the University of Thessaly in Greece. 
In my [dissertation](https://www.didaktorika.gr/eadd/browse?type=author&order=ASC&sort_by=2&rpp=70&value=Τσιμπούκης%2C++Αλέξανδρος+Α.&locale=en), I have worked on oscillatory rarefied gas flows revealing novel non-equilibrium transport phenomena that have strong engineering interest in various technological fields, including microfluidics and vacuum technology. 
The outcome of the the work was 10 publications in peer-reviewed journals including 7 first author papers ([Publication list](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandros-Tsimpoukis/research)). 
Currently, I am a Research Associate at CREPI CERTH in Greece working in energy systems and my main task is to model a a novel thermal storage system in Matlab.
Due to my research I have acquired significant skills in:
+ Scientific software development with Fortran and Matlab,
+ Parallel programming in HPC systems with MPI and OpenMP
+ Advanced simulations with COMSOL and Ansys Fluent,
+ Data analysis with Excel, Matlab and Python Pandas
+ Data visualization with Tecplot360, Matlab and Python Matplotlib
