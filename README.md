## About me 

I am computational scientist working in rarefied gas and multiphase flows with 6+ years of experience in research. 
I earned my PhD in early 2020 (just before the pandemic!) from the University of Thessaly in Greece. 
In my [dissertation](https://www.didaktorika.gr/eadd/browse?type=author&order=ASC&sort_by=2&rpp=70&value=Τσιμπούκης%2C++Αλέξανδρος+Α.&locale=en), I have worked on oscillatory rarefied gas flows revealing novel non-equilibrium transport phenomena that have strong engineering interest in various technological fields, including microfluidics and vacuum technology. 
The range of flow setups extends from oscillatory pressure-driven flows in channels to boundary-driven comb-type structures and the simulations are based on numerical methods which are either deterministic (Discrete Velocity Method) or stochastic (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo). 
Currently, I am an Associate researcher at NCSR "DEMOKRITOS" in Greece working in multiphase flows and my main task is to extend the existing computational fluid particles dynamic code.
