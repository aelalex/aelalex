## About me 

I am computational scientist working in rarefied gas and multiphase flows with 6+ years of experience in research. 
I earned my PhD in early 2020 (just before the pandemic!) from the University of Thessaly in Greece. 
In my [dissertation](https://www.didaktorika.gr/eadd/browse?type=author&order=ASC&sort_by=2&rpp=70&value=Τσιμπούκης%2C++Αλέξανδρος+Α.&locale=en), I have worked on oscillatory rarefied gas flows revealing novel non-equilibrium transport phenomena that have strong engineering interest in various technological fields, including microfluidics and vacuum technology. 
The range of flow setups extends from oscillatory pressure-driven flows in channels to boundary-driven comb-type structures and the simulations are based on numerical methods which are either deterministic (Discrete Velocity Method) or stochastic (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo). The outcome of the the work was 10 publications in peer-reviewed journals including 7 first author papers. 
Currently, I am an Associate researcher at NCSR "DEMOKRITOS" in Greece working in multiphase flows and my main task is to extend the existing computational fluid particles dynamic code.
